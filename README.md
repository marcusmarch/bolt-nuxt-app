# TDS-enabled Timeline

Kicked this off with https://bolt.new/ using prompt like "Nuxt app with timeline of key events. Headline in red 'Days Since XYZ' and date counter underneath"

It built the scaffolding, a Nuxt 3 app. I tweaked it just a bit and used their "Deploy to Netlify" option.
Then I downloaded the zip, imported into this new Github repo, connected my claimed Netlify site to it, and voila!

Continued coding via Github codepsace, it's now auto-deploying to Netlify's https://trump-dictator.netlify.app/

For Nuxt docs, look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

I recommend doing everything in a github codespace. TODO: define the Codespace with extensions that made it easy, so everyone gets them automatically:

### Recommended Extensions in VS Code
1. Prettier

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
